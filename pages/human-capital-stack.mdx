## The [Human Capital Stack](docs/concepts/human-capital-stack.md)

The [human capital](docs/concepts/human-capital.md) hierarchy can be understood through distinct but interconnected layers:

### [Knowledge vs Know-how](docs/concepts/knowledge-knowhow.md)
[Knowledge](docs/concepts/knowledge.md) represents theoretical understanding, while [know-how](docs/concepts/know-how.md) embodies practical implementation capabilities. [Hidalgo](docs/references/hidalgo.md) demonstrates that know-how is fundamentally different from knowledge as it requires [embodied computation](docs/concepts/embodied-computation.md) - the ability to execute rather than just comprehend.

### [Expertise vs Talent](docs/concepts/expertise-talent.md)
[Expertise](docs/concepts/expertise.md) represents acquired specialized capabilities developed through [deliberate practice](docs/concepts/deliberate-practice.md) and experience. In contrast, [talent](docs/concepts/talent.md) manifests as innate or natural abilities that are present from early stages and require minimal effort to develop.

## The [Personbyte Limitation](docs/concepts/personbyte-limitation.md)

[Hidalgo and Hausmann](docs/references/hidalgo-hausmann.md)'s concept of a "[personbyte](docs/concepts/personbyte.md)" represents the fundamental [cognitive limit](docs/concepts/cognitive-limits.md) of an individual's capacity to process and retain knowledge and know-how. This limitation has profound implications:

### [Individual Constraints](docs/constraints/individual.md)
- Humans have finite capacity to acquire [knowledge](docs/concepts/knowledge.md) and [know-how](docs/concepts/know-how.md)
- [Learning](docs/processes/learning.md) takes time and is bounded by lifespan
- Complex tasks require [collaboration](docs/processes/collaboration.md) due to personbyte limits

### [Collective Solutions](docs/solutions/collective.md)
The personbyte limitation drives the need for:
- [Social structures](docs/structures/social.md) that increase information processing capacity
- [Networks](docs/structures/networks.md) for exchanging and distributing knowledge
- [Collaboration](docs/processes/collaboration.md) between individuals with complementary capabilities

This understanding of [human capital components](docs/components/human-capital.md) and their limitations informs [Human Allo](docs/protocols/human-allo.md)'s approach to [talent allocation](docs/mechanisms/talent-allocation.md), recognizing that effective funding must account for both innate capabilities and acquired expertise while acknowledging individual cognitive constraints.
